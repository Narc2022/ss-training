      <b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
      industry. <strong>Lorem Ipsum strong</strong> has been the industry's
      standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a
      galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has
      survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic
      typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
